# PASTA

## Ingredients:
	- Pork (Woolworths roast pork, preferably; saves a lot of time)
	- Swirly pasta (Rotini?)
	- Mushrooms (Standard white, sliced; I use the packaged ones from Woolies/Coles)
	- Cheese (Optional: in case of Parmesan, add just before serving)
	
	---
	> Sauce:
		**Change depending on taste, but I usually make a homemade Thousand Island**
		Recommended options:
		- Thousand Island (homemade):
			- Mayonnaise (don't use any weird types, I tried that and it throws off the flavour way too much to be reliable) [use a hefty amount]
			- Vinegar; I use Rice Wine [very conservative amount]
			- Lemon juice [conservative, but more than vinegar]
			- Tomato paste/purée [liberal amount]
			- Smoked paprika [light sprinkle; if masochistic, ignore and just add way too much]
			- Ground chilli [*very* light sprinkle; again ignore if masochistic]
	
		- Red wine and Italian herbs (makes for a "classic" pasta taste)

## Method:
	1. Put pork in oven, set to 100°C to keep warm while cooking the rest of the dish
	2. Add water to a pot, just enough to cover pasta (**DON'T add pasta yet**)
	3. Add olive oil and salt to water
	4. Set pot on stove to HIGH, wait for rolling boil
	5. If making homemade sauce, start experimenting with the ratios now while waiting for the boil
	6. When water hits a rolling boil, add pasta, then stir periodically - remove when completely soft and springy; recommend taste/texture testing
	7. While pasta cooks, add butter and oil to a pan and set to low/medium - temperature should cause butter to sizzle but not to darken and burn
	8. Cook mushrooms in pan, make sure they soak up the butter - they will shrink to a more easily consumable size, so no need to cut them up much unless you prefer to do so
	9. Once mushrooms are appropriately cooked to a soft texture, add sauce and set heat to low - this will likely happen before the pasta is done, so keep it from cooling too much
	10. When pasta is done, drain water and toss pasta gently
	11. Add spices to taste (garlic, onion, pepper, *maybe* salt), add pan contents to pot and mix thoroughly
	12. Add sauce if not added already, mix in or drizzle over dish after serving
	13. Cut up pork - recommend using small pieces and mixing through the dish
	14. Serve
